# Snow
A terrible Minecraft server implementation made by one man in C#

## Should you use it?

No. I dont see anyone using this for anything public yet. It could be used as a framework to make more stuff on tho.
Documentation is not a thing, yet.

## Current 
'snow' version p24.3.27.0
Minecraft: 1.20.4
Protocol: 765

## Features
- Worldgenerators
- Chunk loading (not unloading)
- Addons (aka plugins)
- Very basic multiplayer


## Why?
I made this just for fun to see how far I could get. also so I can make plugins in C# cuz that sounded fun.
